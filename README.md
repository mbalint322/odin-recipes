Odin Recipes project 
What I made: 
A main page with an unordered list of recipes linking to other pages
These other pages all contain a recipe with an image,
an unordered list of ingredients
and an ordered list of the steps needed to make it.

I practiced using git, making git commits 
and learning how often it makes sense to make them
and how detailed I should be with the messages.

I feel like this is something that is going to take
a pretty long time to learn.
